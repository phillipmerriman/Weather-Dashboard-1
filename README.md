# Weather-Dashboard-1
Did you ever wonder what the weather was outside? I know I did. And by golly, I didnt have a way to find out! My house had no windows to see outside, no doors to open which I could poke my head out of and have a sniff of the air. So, I decided to make an app to do all this for me. Now, I can simply search for a city, and voila! I know the weather of whichever city I want!
